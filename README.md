# Customer Churn Prediction Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## Overview
This project involves building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn based on a dataset containing customer demographics, account details, and behavioral features. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and feature encoding. The model achieved an accuracy of 85%, offering valuable insights into customer retention strategies.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow, scikit-learn
- Model: Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer information, including:
- Demographics: Age, gender, geographic region, etc.
- Account Details: Tenure, balance, salary, etc.
- Behavioral Features: Number of products bought, active member, etc.
Source: The dataset was obtained from an online public repository.

## Preprocessing 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualized data distribution across key demographics (e.g., age, gender, tenure).
- Identified churn rates within different customer segments.
Data Cleaning:
- Addressed missing values and outliers.
- Removed irrelevant or redundant features.
Feature Encoding:
- Converted categorical variables into numerical format using one-hot encoding and label encoding.
- Normalized numerical features for consistent scaling.

## Results
- Achieved an accuracy of 85%. 

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy further.
- Add advanced feature engineering techniques to enhance model inputs.
- Deploy the model using a web interface or API for real-time predictions
